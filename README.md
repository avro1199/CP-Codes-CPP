# CP Codes in C++

A collection of C++ codes, templates, and solutions for various competitive programming problems and algorithms.

## About

This repository serves as a personal archive and resource hub for C++ code used in competitive programming contests (like Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, etc.). It contains reusable templates, standard algorithms, and problem-specific solutions to help with fast coding and learning.

## Structure

- `/Templates/`: Commonly used C++ templates (e.g., fast I/O, segment tree, DSU, etc.)
- `/Algorithms/`: Implementations of sorting, searching, graph algorithms, DP, etc.
- `/Problems/`: Solutions to specific CP problems, organized by platform or topic.
- `/Snippets/`: Handy code snippets for quick reference.

## Usage

1. Browse the folders for the code you need.
2. Copy and adapt the templates or solutions for your own use in contests or practice.
3. Contribute improvements or new code!

## Contribution

Feel free to submit pull requests with your own C++ CP templates or solutions. Suggestions and corrections are welcome.
